            <p>
               <b> Sketching</b> is a hobby I enjoy in my free time. <br>
                 I like how simple it is—all I need is a pencil and some paper. <br>
                 When I sketch, I feel relaxed and it helps me take my mind off things. <br>
                  I usually draw things I see around me, 
                  like objects on my desk or scenes from outside my window. <br> I am not an expert, 
                  but I notice that I get a little better each time I practice. 
                </p>
                <p>
                      I want to explore more areas of it. So far, I have mostly done simple sketches with pencils, but now I want to try using colors like watercolors and markers 
                      to make my drawings more lively. <br> 
                      I’m also interested in learning digital drawing using apps on my tablet or computer. Besides that, I want to practice 
                      drawing different subjects like animals, landscapes, and cartoons to improve my skills. <br>
                      Exploring these new styles and tools will help me become a better artist and keep drawing fun and exciting for me.

            <h1 align = "center">my daily routine </h1>
            <h2>morning</h2>
            <p>I usually wake up late, around 10 or 11 in the morning. <br> 
                Since there are no regular college classes, I don’t have a fixed time to get up. <br> 
                After waking up, I spend some time on my phone, checking messages and scrolling through social media.  <br>
                I don’t always eat a proper breakfast—sometimes I just have tea or snacks. </p>
            <h2>afternoon</h2>
            <p> From today, I have joined a training program. <br> The classes are from 2 PM to 6 PM, so my afternoons are now busy with that. <br> Before the classes start, I try to relax or prepare a little. <br> It feels different from my usual lazy afternoons.</p>
            <h2>evening</h2>
            <p> After the training ends, I usually relax at home. <br>
                Dinner is always with my family, which I enjoy. After dinner, I spend some time watching movies or chatting online. <br>
                 I often stay up late because I don’t have a strict schedule.
